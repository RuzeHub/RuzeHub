🌟 Project features:

 Automatic DATABASE initialization - creates the users.db file at the first startup

 Duplicate protection - UNIQUE constraint for logins

 Administrative access - a special --d command to view the data

 Secure Queries - using parameterized queries to protect against SQL injections

⚠️ Important notes:

 For real-world use, you should add password hashing.

 It is recommended to restrict access to the users.db file

 The --d command must be protected by additional authentication.

🚀 Possible improvements:

 Add a user role system

 Implement logging of actions

 Add the ability to change your password

 Create a graphical interface
